"""Arkadium Testing Arena local frontend.

This file is intentionally written as a transparent, single-file experiment
runner. It is more verbose than a production web app because the project is a
research workflow: reviewers should be able to inspect how games, models,
rounds, logs, and exports are created without chasing hidden framework magic.

Run from the repository root:

    python3 live_connect_four_app.py

Then open the printed local URL, choose a game and provider/model preset,
paste the matching API key, and click "Run selected model vs Random".
